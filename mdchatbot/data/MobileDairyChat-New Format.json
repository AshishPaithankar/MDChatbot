      "description": "This guide covers all major collection-related settings within the Mobile Dairy App. Collection settings help configure how milk is collected from farmers and include the following:\n\n1. Milk Collection Type based on FAT, SNF, CLR, and other parameters.\n2. Type of milk collected—Cow, Buffalo, or Both.\n3. Collection Inputs—whether entries are made Manually, Automatically, or through a Weighing Scale.\n4. Collection Shifts—configured for Morning, Evening, or both.\n5. Offline Collection Settings—option to allow data entry without internet.\n6. Shift Timings—customizable start and end times for Morning and Evening shifts.\n7. Collection Print Settings—customizable receipts in 7 regional languages with required fields and formats.",

          "description": "While collecting milk, the rate is determined based on FAT Content, SNF Content, and Auto CLR. These settings help record these milk parameters, which are then used to calculate the rate with the help of the rate chart saved.\n\nFAT refers to milk fat, also known as butterfat, which is the natural fat found in milk. It is measured as a percentage of the milk's weight, such as '3.5% fat' meaning that 3.5% of the milk’s weight is fat. This percentage affects the milk's texture and calorie content.\n\nSNF stands for Solids Not Fat, which includes all the non-fat, non-water components of milk such as proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. For example, '7.5%' SNF means that 7.5% of the milk's content is made up of solids other than fat.\n\nCLR stands for Corrected Lactometer Reading, which measures the quality and density of milk. This value helps assess if water has been added to the milk.\n\nThe Collection Type settings allow you to define the method by which milk data is collected and recorded in the Mobile Dairy App.",
